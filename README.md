Chemical table files for constraint-based modelling

This repo contains the molecular structures of metabolites present in Recon3D and its metabolic reactions atom mapped. The data is divided into 2 main directories:

* MET: All the molecular structures collected in MDL MOL file format			
* * images
* * molFiles
* * molComparison: Collection of molecular structures from different databases
* * * CHEBI: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/
* * * HMDB: https://hmdb.ca/
* * * InChI
* * * KEGG: https://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html
* * * PubChem: https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
* * * SMILES

* RXN: 
* * atomMapped: Atom mapped MDL RXN files
* * images: Images of the atom mapped reactions
* * rxnFiles: Un mapped metabolic reactions in MDL RXN file format
* * txtData: Atom mapped in SMILES and additional atom mapped data
